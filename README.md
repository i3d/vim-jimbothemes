# vim-jimbothemes
Self developed morden vim themes (mainly for neovim)

I created these themes myself via wandering around the beautiful wallpapers in
[wallpaperbetter.com](https://www.wallpaperbetter.com/)

I don't know the original authors of these wallpapers but the inspiration credits go to them.

Theme nordic-aurora was inspired from [ImageGoNord](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/ImageGoNord). Color palette was strictly followed the guideline there. Credits go to them.

I have not yet found a suitable wallpapers for this theme.
