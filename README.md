# vim-jimbothemes
Self developed morden vim themes (mainly for neovim)

I created these themes myself via wandering around the beautiful wallpapers in
[wallpaperbetter.com](https://www.wallpaperbetter.com/)

I don't know the original authors of these wallpapers but the inspiration credits go to them.

Theme nordic-aurora was inspired from [ImageGoNord](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/ImageGoNord). Color palette was strictly followed the guideline there. Credits go to them. I have not yet found a suitable wallpaper for this theme.

All theme wallpapers are under the wallpapers subdir. The nordic-aurora wallpaper credit goes to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nordtheme/comments/f1dyk2/made_this_wallpaper_from_a_graphic_on_nords/)
